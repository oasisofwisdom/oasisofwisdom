        <br><br>
        As you step out today, I pray for you that whatever that is standing as wilderness in your life shall give way for your fruitfulness. Anything that has been consuming your life, your finances, your profits, your glory, shall be consumed by the consuming fire of the Holy ghost in the mighty name of Jesus. 
        <br><br>
        Paradventure you are going through any form of wilderness experience; it will not consume you. You will come out victoriously to show forth the glory of God in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        Lack, is a form of wilderness, failure is a form of wilderness, ill-health is equally a form of wilderness. No matter the type of your wilderness experience, God will make you victorious over such in the mighty name of Jesus.  
        <br><br>
        You will henceforth speak of the glory of God. Challenges of life will be subdued before you. You will speak of the wonder working power of God. You will testify about the faithfulness of God in your life in the mighty name of Jesus. 
        <br><br>
        The Lord will step into your situation with unprecedented miracle that will draw men to the saving knowledge of Christ in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        The power of God’s word will remove every evil thought throwing fear at you. Your mind will no longer entertain evil thoughts in the name of Jesus. 
        <br><br>
        So shall it be, in Jesus name I have prayed.  Amen.`

        <br><br>
        As you step out today, I pray for you, you will keep a comfortable distance away from trouble. Those who have covenanted to destroy your life and your integrity will be dissapointed because the Lord will fight for you. The presence of God will shield you and pilot you away from trouble in the name of Jesus. 
        <br><br>
        Your integrity will not crash, the testimony of your life will retain the fragrance of favour that will make you likeable and acceptable to your destiny helpers in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        Your destiny helpers will not suddenly become a friend to your haters. God's favour will kill the venom of every evil report sponsored by your haters in the mighty name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        God's favour will uphold your reputation. God’s power will sustain your integrity and your progress will not be truncated in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        The Lord will open close doors for you to fulfill your purpose in life. The fragrance of God’s favour will be upon you and make it imposible for conspiracy of the enemies to succeed against you in the mighty name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        Thank you, Lord Jesus, because it is done. In Jesus name I have prayed. Amen.`

        text: `God is by all means deserving of our praises. We owe Him gratitude and thanksgiving as the biggest thing we can offer  Him for His manifold blessings unto us. 
        <br><br>
        Entitlement mentality which is the attitude that shows that you deserve whatever God has done for you is the reason some people cannot give quality thanks to God. 
        <br><br>
        At this point in the year, God has done so much for us and therefore we are so greatful. Psalms  34:1,3,4 says... I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
        <br><br>
        I pray for you, each time you look back, you will have plenty things to thank God for. The cloud of promises of good things that are ahead will not turn to a whirlwind of destruction in Jesus name.
        <br><br>
        Multiple open doors and blessings will compete to fulfill God’s agenda for your life. You will be fortified by God to be able to conserve God’s blessings in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        God’s grace will combine with your efforts to succeed in life. New era of success will begin in your life as from now in the mighty name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        God will look upon you with unfathomable favour, showers of heaven will be released upon your land to irrigate your seed and reward your labour with aboundant harvest in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        Thank you Lord because it is done. In Jesus name I have prayed.  Amen.`

        text: `The amosphere of love is the breeding ground of great things while the atmosphere of hatred is the breeding ground of every form of evil. 
        <br><br>
        I therefore pray for you today that the Lord will separate you from every form of toxic atmosphere and plant you in an atmoshere of love where you will flourish and not diminish in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        The Lord wll remove you from every form of unpleasant situation and surround you with an atmosphere of love. Those who have been your advesary will be forced to love you. Receive the divine wisdom to manage all your adversasaries in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        The Lord will command peace in your life and around your life. You will not be at the mercy of the enemy. The fire of the Holy Ghost will consume every thorn and blockage hindering your fruitfulness in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        The Lord will insulate your life against every form of charm. You will not die any careless death. You will not eat poison. Power of charm will not prevail over you in the mighty name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        Nothing created by God will support the enemies to be against your life and everything you possess. The Lord will give you victory over the devil and his cohorts. Your all-round victory will be preserved. You will not loose your final victory over the devil in the mighty name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        This day, I mean today will yield its increase for you. Your storehouses are blessed. Your land is blessed and God shall open His good tressure upon your life in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        So shall it be, in Jesus name I have prayed. Amen.`

        <br><br>
        I pray for you, this new month will be your month of shield of favour. You will keep comfortable distance away from trouble. You will be secured under the canopy of favour and special security of the Almighty in the mighty name of Jesus.

        Psalms 12:5 says ...For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
        <br><br>
        I pray for you, in this month and beyond, God’s favour will surround you as a shield to dissapoint and frustrate every evil plan that is against you in the name of Jesus. 
        <br><br>
        God’s favour will make it impossible for hatred to succeed against you. I say in the name of Jesus, hatred will not succeed against your life. You will enjoy the favour of those that hold the key to your breakthrough in the mighty name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        God’s favour will accompany your glory and shield you from destiny destroyers in the name of Jesus.

        Your home will witness immeasurable power of the Almighty God and the testimony of your home will bring many to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.

        All power working against the fruitfulness of your home shall perish. Blessings of God in all dimension will saturate your life and home in the name of Jesus.

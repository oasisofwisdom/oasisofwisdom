        Psalms 23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

        As you step out today, evil will not cling on you. No any problem that defies personal and collective prayer of the saint will rise against you. You will not become a victim to be pitied and will not witness adverse condition of life that will make satanic suggestion appears reasonable to you in the mighty name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        The Lord will not allow you to go through any negative experience that will make people to ridicule the name of Christ that you bear. You will not be tempted to put your confidence in any other power outside God in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        You shall not be tempted out of God’s watch to do anything that will end in destruction. The spirit of God will dictate all your steps and keeps vigils over you and over everything that belong to you in the name of Jesus.

        As you take up your activities for today, the wonders of God will accompany you and help you to discover the spring of refreshing water, that will nourish your soul and renew your strength in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        Divine provision will surface for you in the hour of unexpected shortage of supply. Your journey today will not end in frustration in Jesus name.
        <br><br>
        You will not give up your aspiration for promotion. Discouragement will not replace your courage to make it. Your journey to success will not be aborted, every effort you put in place to record landmark achievement will not be frustrated in the mighty name of Jesus.

        Psalms 23 will become your testimony now and forever in Jesus name.
        <br><br>
        Let us recite Psalms 23 together:
        <br><br>
        23:1 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  
        <br>
        23:2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  
        <br>
        23:3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  
        <br>
        23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  
        <br>
        23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  
        <br>
        23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.`

        Life is a complex mixture of contradictions. To succeed in life, you must be helped by God to maneuver your way out of life ironies and contradictions.
        <br><br>
        I pray for you, evil contradictions that makes the first to become the last and make the best to serve the least will not have impact on your life in Jesus name.
        <br><br>
        Errors that can terminate your life will not happen in your life. Errors that can abort your career ingloriously will not hang on you in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        The power of God will set you free from the evil contradiction of labouring in vain or labouring for the benefit of others in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        Just as it happened to Joseph in the bible, let all oppositions that rises against you contribute to your promotion and I say in the name of Jesus, I command all inherited genes of failure and backwardness to loose their influence over your destiny in the mighty name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        All those who persecute you will live to regret how they have helped to perfect God’s programme for your life in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        As you continue in your journey in life, you will not suffer in the reward of the wicked or suffer pain while the unrighteous enjoy pleasures in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        So shall it be, in Jesus name I have prayed. Amen.`

        <br><br>
        Ecclesiastes 3:16: And moreover, I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
        <br><br>
        The Psalmist in Psalm 73 highlighted and lamented some of those contradictions...
        <br>
        1. I have seen under the sun where those who put in their best in life least enjoy the best from their labour; while some who do nothing enjoy the best from other men’s sweat.
        <br>
        2. We live in a world where majority call evil good and good evil.
        <br>
        3. We live in a world where some hide under God to visit their fellow men with evil.
        <br>
        4. We are in a world where strangers are sometimes more friendly than relatives.
        <br>
        5. Life contradiction is more disturbing as we watch the escalation of the conspiracy of a global system that celebrates the wicked and persecutes the righteous.
        <br><br>
        Where do we go from here?
        <br><br>
        Understand that God is a righteous judge, He will finally judge both the good and the bad and reward everyone accordingly.
        <br><br>
        Psalm 37:1-4
        <br>
        Fret not thyself because of evildoers... Trust in the LORD... Delight thyself also in the LORD...`

        <br><br>
        You will enjoy the attention of God that will put an end to every form of tension in your life. Every department of your life will witness divine intervention and you will not fall into the trap set for your downfall in the name of Jesus.
        <br><br>
        Your hands will be upon the neck of your enemies. You will ride on their back to fulfill God’s purpose for your life...
